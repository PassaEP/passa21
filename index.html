            <p><b>General Representative - Bruin Solutions</b></p>
            <p style='padding:4rem; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top:5px'>I’m a third year bioengineering student running for General Representative with Bruin Solutions. As a public university, we are obligated to ensure that every student has the same access to opportunity and success. My office will implement bold policy to uplift underserved students and improve campus life for all. </p>

            <h2 id="majpoly"> Major Policies</h2>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Compensate learning assistants and undergraduate researchers with</b> the USAC Surplus and/or federal work study so that students with less resources are not blocked out from these activities.  </li>
              <li><b>Establish a summer bootcamp to prepare freshly admitted STEM students from underserved backgrounds to learn science fundamentals</b> they need to succeed in Year One and also form peer groups early on to improve retention. </li>
              <li><b> Install menstrual product dispensers in ALL restrooms across campus.</b> </li>
              <li><b>Improve coffee quality on campus</b> by analyzing and revising coffee brewing practices at on-campus eateries and cafes.  </li>
              <li><b> Work with the Facilities Commission to install hand sanitizer dispensers</b> and pressure administration to refill existing dispensers more often. </li>
              <li><b> Expand BruinCast capability</b> to every lecture hall on campus, and incentivize professors to stream lectures, so that course enrollment numbers are not limited by Fire Marshall regulations. </li>
              <li><b>Expand the learning assistant program</b> further, so that discussion sections can accommodate more students. </li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Platform</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><h2> Uplifting Underserved Groups </h2>Retention rates for BIPOC and marginalized students are worse across the board. We need to work to even the playing field by focusing on academic preparation programs and increasing access to academic enrichment opportunities such as undergraduate research. </li>
              <li><h2> Health and Sustainability </h2> We’re living in a pandemic, so public health is a priority especially as we go back. With thousands of students on campus, sanitation stations need to be everywhere and plentiful. Menstrual products should also be available in ALL restrooms across campus. </li>
              <li><h2> Improving Enrollment </h2> Enrollment period is stressful for all undergrads, especially for impacted courses. To solve this, we can accommodate more students in impacted courses by expanding BruinCast (so students don’t have to physically be in class) or expanding the learning assistant program. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Qualifications</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><h2>Undergraduate Researcher at UCLA & Visiting Undergraduate Research Fellow at UCSF</h2> I’m an engineering student with extensive research experience at UCLA and other UCs, so I understand the value of academic enrichment and how they impact lives. I also understand the competitive funding landscape for undergrad projects. </li>
              <li><h2>UCLAxUCSF Institute for Global Health Sciences COVID-19 Research Watch</h2> I have helped members of the public, clinicians, and scientists review and understand new COVID-19 information as it’s released. Thus, I’m able to effectively communicate public health ideas quickly and effectively for policy practice.   </li>
